# Internet Banking RESTful service

## Introduction
You are developing an internal interface for a Banking systems as a *RESTful API*.
One of the requirements is to implement a simple interface for an Internet Banking System.

## Problem Statement

To complete this task, you have to add a new custom controller in the ***`InternetBankingRESTfulService.Web`*** project (directly, withourt any folders) which will implement the `InternetBankingRESTfulService.Api.IInternetBankingApi` interface.
*Remember* that the controller should implement the interface as a *RESTful API*.
***Again, remember*** that you should create your new controller ***in*** `InternetBankingRESTfulService.Web` project ***not in `InternetBankingRESTfulService.Api`!***
***Do not add*** any other file (except the required controller) or any folder to any project in the solution.
***Avoid changing*** other files as they are marked as readonly and the verification process may fail.

Requirements:

* The `GetApiVersion` method should return the current version (1.0) in the following format: `YYYY.MM.DD.1.0`, where:
    * YYYY is the current year (UTC time), 
    * MM is the current month (UTC time), 
    * DD is the current day (UTC time).

- The `CalculateMD5` should calculate the MD5 hash for the data passed as a function parameter:
	- Before calculate MD5 the all digits in *value* parameter should be replaced by 'X' char (ex.: "asd4-56" should be replaced to "asdX-XX")
	- The MD5 hash should be returned as hex characters (for example test-string-1 should be replaced to test-string-X and MD5 should be D3F0A6CF3F628B90DBF0B57E661D193F).
	- The passed parameter will never be empty.
	
* The `IsPasswordStrong` should check if the passed password (as a parameter) is strong. 
	The password will be recognized as strong if it is:
		- at least twelve characters long and 
		- contains at least one uppercase letter and
		- contains at least one lowercase letter and 
		- contains at least one digit and 
		- contains at least one character from: @!*+- 
		- doesn't contain any white-space characters

### Configure endpoints availability
***Remember*** that you're ***not allowed*** to make any changes to `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` and other files, so you have to configure availability in your controller.

* The `GetApiVersion` should be available at both: `bank/api/version` and `bank/api-version` url.
* The `CalculateMD5` should be available at both: `bank/api/calc/MD5/<passed md5 value>` and `bank/api/calc/<passed md5 value>/MD5` url.
* The `IsPasswordStrong` should be available at both: `bank/api/password/strong/<passed md5 value>` and `bank/api/is-password-strong/<passed md5 value>` url.

## Important
**NOTE:** Please, make sure **not to change** the task structure/refactor code, as it can **break verification** process. 
**NOTE:** If you add your own tests to ApiTest.cs, you should undo the changes before submitting the solution for validation.
**NOTE:** Do not add any other file (except the required controller) or any folder to any project in the solution and avoid changing other files as they are marked as readonly and the verification process may fail.

## Hints
1. Your solution should pass all tests.
2. You're ***not*** suposed to inject anything in your new custom controller construtor.
